# Learnings
 Use this section to list any new thing you learned when you were working on the project. Show readers and recruiters the skills you picked up.
##Example
During the development of MyJournal, I gained valuable experience and skills in the following areas:

- **User Authentication:** Implemented secure user authentication using JWT tokens.

- **React and Redux:** Enhanced proficiency in React.js and state management with Redux.

- **Database Design:** Worked on designing and implementing a MongoDB database schema.

- **Testing Strategies:** Explored and implemented frontend and backend testing strategies.

# Improvement
Use this section to list the areas the project can be improved. Those features that are too complex to add, bugs, or an improvement to the existing features. Youâ€™d be surprised to see that some other developers are willing to collaborate and add them.
##Example
Areas for potential improvement and future development include:

- **Collaborative Features:** Implement collaborative journaling for multiple users.

- **Export/Import Feature:** Add functionality to export and import journal entries.

- **Encryption:** Enhance security by implementing end-to-end encryption for user data.

# How to run the project
Add a step-by-step process of how other developers can run the project. Be very clear about the infrastructure used alongside the right commands. Add possible errors anyone running the project might face and how to get around them.
##Example
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/myjournal.git
2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd myjournal
   npm install
3. Set Environment Variables:
   Create a `.env` file with appropriate configurations for MongoDB and JWT.
4. Visit the app
   Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000.
5. Possible Errors:
    - If MongoDB connection fails, ensure MongoDB is running.
    - Check console logs for any other errors during startup.

# Bonus
Add demo videos and images

# Work process
What did you do first? What challenges did you face? how did you fix them? How long did it take you to complete the project? etc
##Example
  - Started with wireframing and design.
  - Implemented backend functionality first, focusing on user authentication.
  - Gradually built the frontend, iteratively adding features.
  - Faced challenges in testing, particularly with asynchronous operations.
  - Regularly committed code to version control for better collaboration.
  - Completed the project in approximately 4 weeks.


And there you have it, I hope this helps. Just clone this and edit with your project details.
